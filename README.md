# FichteFoll's dotfiles

These are my dotfiles
as I use them on Arch Linux.
Feel free to use them however you like.

The files are primaritly managed with *stow*,
the GNU software package installation manager.
See [here][stow-guide] for an introduction.

In short,
clone the repo into your home folder,
cd into it and run `stow pkgnamesâ€¦`.

I have a different branch for my notebook-specific overrides.
